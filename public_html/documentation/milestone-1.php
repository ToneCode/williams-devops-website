		<h3>Frustrations</h3>

			risks and catch bugs quickly, but also move rapidly toward working software. This allows for greater
			collaboration between ops and delivery.</p>
		<h3>Use Case:</h3>

			Specialist.
			Based on a brief look at my resume, he has included my name on a list of potential people to search for on
			LinkedIn. After viewing my LinkedIn profile, he noticed my training in Puppet Labs and RedHat Open Stack,
			he decided to go a step further and visit my web site for more information.</p>
