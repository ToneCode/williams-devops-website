		<h2>Job Title and Major Responsibilities</h2>
		<p>Chief Information Officer</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Name: Matthew Findley</li>
		<li>Age: 51</li>
		<li>Married</li>
		<li>Father of three children</li>
		<li>Has a MBA in Business and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Matthew is focused, goal-oriented with a strong leadership role. One of his
			concerns is maintaining quality across all groups under his management.  He
			spends the majority of his time:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Requesting and reviewing research reports.</li>
		<li>Preparing memos and briefs for all agency heads.</li>
		<li>Managing cross sectional teams within the organization.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Environment</h2>
		<p>He has a custom built 27" MacBook pro desktop and a 13" MacBook Air laptop.  Uses
			the internet several hours daily for work and utilizes an iPad exclusively to read books.
			He uses social media to communicate information about the company on FaceBook and LinkedIn.</p>
		<h2>Frustrations</h2>
		<p>Most days, product managers spent significant time with the developers in formal meetings or
			ad-hoc discussions championing, designing and re-scoping features. The developers have also found
			that the need for continuous automation methodology can help them automate the entire build process.
			</p>
		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<p>To Hire someone with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment skills, to not only reduce
			risks and catch bugs quickly, but also move rapidly toward working software.  This allows for greater
			collaboration between ops and delivery.</p>
		<h2>Use Case:</h2>
		<p>Matthew has done a brief look at my personal web site for more information.  He has also viewed my LinkedIn
			profile and decided to schedule a 15 minute phone screening call, to see if I would be a good fit to join his team.</p>
