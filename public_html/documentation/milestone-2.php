		<h3>Proposed Site Map</h3>
		<p>Site will consist of 3 top-level pages total. No sub-pages or sub-navigation. This will be the Minimum Value
			Product.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Home Page</li>
			<li>About Me</li>
			<li>Contact</li>
		</ul>
		<div>
			<h3>Content Strategy</h3>
			<p><strong>Home Page:</strong>A brief introduction that clearly states my name and role as a Full Stack
				Developer, and will feature 2 calls to action that will direct the user to the About Me page or Contact
				page. </p>
			<p><strong>About Me:</strong>This page will detail my professional history, core skill set, and professional
				highlights. This page will showcase my strengths and personality. I will feature a contrasting side bar that
				list my core skills which will be easily readable at a glance. The tone of voice will be casual and
				personable, indicating that I am only interested in opportunities with organizations that I am a good
				personality fit. </p>
			<p><strong>Contact:</strong>This page will contain a simple contact form, my professional email address, and
				links to my professional social media profiles: LinkedIn, Twitter and GitHub. These will also be linked in
				the footer site wide via icons. This page may be integrated into my About Me page if content is short. </p>
		</div>
		<h3>Interaction Flow</h3>
		<p>Matthew is viewing the site on his desktop computer at the office, with a 27" screen, using Safari. He has 29
			other tabs open. From LinkedIn, he links to my personal website which opens in a new window. In the next 3
			minutes, here is an outline of Matthew's interactions with my site: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Lands on Home page. Views a "quote where I describe my work flow" Clicks call to action that navigates to
				the About Me page.
			</li>
			<li>Views my core skills featured in a contrasting side panel. Finds my professional history to be outstanding.
				The interaction stops there. Matthew has decided, based on the information provided, that I will be included
				in the preliminary phone screens. He does not need to navigate away, because my contact info is visible in
				the footer. Matthew leaves the About Me page open for reference during the preliminary phone call.
			</li>
		</ol>
