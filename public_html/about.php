				<h3>About me, and why I started the journey to DevOps</h3>
				<p>During a 22 hour flight from San Francisco to Cochin, India on Emirates Airline. I knew I would need
					something to help pass the
					time,
					so I brought several books along for the ride. Why India, well for one I have always dreamed of
					visiting
					India and lets face it I'm not getting any younger. Also second to the US, India offers some of the
					most
					advanced IT training courses in the world. When I'm on vacation I always try to find a training course
					for
					professional enrichment, so I located a company teaching the official RedHat linux training course,
					booked my flight and off I went. My
					feeling
					is by taking RedHat linux training it would enhance my career transition from health-care into the
					world of
					technology. My background includes working in Telecommunications with Verizon, primarily in the
					DataCenter doing
					tier II support with Lucent and Cisco systems equipment. Linux training would round out my operations
					expertise.</p>
				<p>After settling into the flight, I grabbed a book to read titled "The Phoenix Project", now before
					reading it
					I thought it was going to be lots of war stories about various projects the team had worked on,
					instead it
					described the evolution of the IT department in a company that was on the verge of complete failure.
					In a
					fast-paced and entertaining style, the three visionaries of the DevOps movement deliver a story that
					anyone
					who has worked in IT would recognize as I was captivated til the very last page. This book has been the
					single
					reason
					that I'm pursuing a career in DevOps.</p>
				<h3>Embrace DevOps, or get left behind</h3>
				<p>Over the past four years, the Puppet Labs State of DevOps Report has shed more light on DevOps, IT
					performance and organizational performance than any other research of its kind based on responses from
					over 20,000 tech professionals worldwide.</p>
				<h3>My DevOps Skills</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						SysAdmin - I can build and administer linux severs.
					</li>
					<li>
						Virtualization - I have experience with VMware, Kvm, Xen, and Hyper-V.
					</li>
					<li>
						Technical Background - I have experience with networking, storage, and high availability uptime.
					</li>
					<li>
						Scripting - I have experience with Bash, PHP, Ruby, and Python.
					</li>
					<li>
						Developer - I am a jr. Developer who can write scripts that automate Deployments.
					</li>
					<li>
						Automation Tools - I'm familiar with Chef, Puppet, and Ansible.
					</li>
					<li>
						People Skills - I believe fault tolerance and scalability happens at the people level too.
					</li>
					<li>
						Customer Service - I believe it takes a special person to listen to feed back, especially when your
						being
						hammered by a customer on the other end of a status update.
					</li>
					<li>
						Cloud Experience - I have experience deploying applications to AWS cloud platform.
					</li>
					<li>
						Someone Who Cares - I'm someone who likes to mentor others, and train new staff members.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Finding from the 2015 State of DevOps Report:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						High-performing IT organizations experience 60X fewer failures and recover from failure 168X faster
						than their lower-performing peers. They also deploy 30X more frequently with 200X shorter lead
						times.
					</li>
					<li>Lean management and continuous delivery practices create the conditions for delivering value
						faster, sustainably.
					</li>
					<li>High performance is achievable no matter if your apps are greenfield, brownfield or legacy.</li>
					<li>DevOps initiatives launched solely by C-level executives or from the grassroots are less likely to
						succeed.
					</li>
					<li>IT managers play a critical role in promoting diversity and limiting burnout.</li>
				</ul>

			<p>Companies that incorporate DevOps practices get more done, plain and simple. They deploy code up to 30
				times more frequently than their competition. And less than 50% of their deployments fail according to
				Puppet Labs 2015 State of DevOps survey.
				The biggest shift in attitude within a DevOps environment is that there is one team composed of
				cross-functional team members including developers, QA, DBAs, business analysts, operations engineers and
				so forth. Collaboration across these different roles can now deliver many benefits.</p>
			<p>Communication advocated by DevOps means that everyone involved work together to clearly define the code's
				purpose and requirements. DevOps also reduces the number of hand-offs, which cause delays and wasted
				effort. Your confidence in the
				software's functionality and stability increases as the code moves through the pipeline. By the time you
				reach the final production stage, you know you can safely release your latest feature, improvement or bug
				fix to the world.</p>
