		<h3>About me, and why I started the journey to DevOps</h3>
		<p>During a 22 hour flight from San Francisco to Cochin, India on Emirates Airline. I knew I would need
			something to help pass the
			time,
			so I brought several books along for the ride. Why India, well for one I have always dreamed of
			visiting
			India and lets face it I'm not getting any younger. Also second to the US, India offers some of the
			most
			advanced IT training courses in the world. When I'm on vacation I always try to find a training course
			for
			professional enrichment, so I located a company teaching the official RedHat linux training course,
			booked my flight and off I went. My
			feeling
			is by taking RedHat linux training it would enhance my career transition from health-care into the
			world of
			technology. My background includes working in Telecommunications with Verizon, primarily in the
			DataCenter doing
			tier II support with Lucent and Cisco systems equipment. Linux training would round out my operations
			expertise.</p>
		<p>After settling into the flight, I grabbed a book to read titled "The Phoenix Project", now before
			reading it
			I thought it was going to be lots of war stories about various projects the team had worked on,
			instead it
			described the evolution of the IT department in a company that was on the verge of complete failure.
			In a
			fast-paced and entertaining style, the three visionaries of the DevOps movement deliver a story that
			anyone
			who has worked in IT would recognize as I was captivated til the very last page. This book has been the
			single
			reason
			that I'm pursuing a career in DevOps.</p>
		<h3>Embrace DevOps, or get left behind</h3>
		<p>Over the past four years, the Puppet Labs State of DevOps Report has shed more light on DevOps, IT
			performance and organizational performance than any other research of its kind based on responses from
			over 20,000 tech professionals worldwide.</p>
