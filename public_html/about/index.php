				<h3>About me, and why I started the journey to DevOps</h3>
				<p>During a 22 hour flight from San Francisco to Cochin, India on Emirates Airline. I knew I would need
					something to help pass the
					time,
					so I brought several books along for the ride. Why India, well for one I have always dreamed of
					visiting
					India and lets face it I'm not getting any younger. Also second to the US, India offers some of the
					most
					advanced IT training courses in the world. When I'm on vacation I always try to find a training course
					for
					professional enrichment, so I located a company teaching the official RedHat linux training course,
					booked my flight and off I went. My
					feeling
					is by taking RedHat linux training it would enhance my career transition from health-care into the
					world of
					technology. My background includes working in Telecommunications with Verizon, primarily in the
					DataCenter doing
					tier II support with Lucent and Cisco systems equipment. Linux training would round out my operations
					expertise.</p>
				<p>After settling into the flight, I grabbed a book to read titled "The Phoenix Project", now before
					reading it
					I thought it was going to be lots of war stories about various projects the team had worked on,
					instead it
					described the evolution of the IT department in a company that was on the verge of complete failure.
					In a
					fast-paced and entertaining style, the three visionaries of the DevOps movement deliver a story that
					anyone
					who has worked in IT would recognize as I was captivated til the very last page. This book has been the
					single
					reason
					that I'm pursuing a career in DevOps.</p>
				<h3>Embrace DevOps, or get left behind</h3>
				<p>Over the past four years, the Puppet Labs State of DevOps Report has shed more light on DevOps, IT
					performance and organizational performance than any other research of its kind based on responses from
					over 20,000 tech professionals worldwide.</p>
